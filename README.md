I have taken several computer science courses here at New Paltz including software engineering, operating systems, and object oriented programming. The most interesting project I've had the opportunity to work on has been a grocery store point of sales system for my software engineering class. I enjoyed that project in particular because I got the opportunity to create something from scrath and work in a collaborative setting. 

I see myself using what I've experienced in this course to determine what I'd do with my degree, web and software programming are increadibly attractive fields but also very challenging. But short of that I see myself using what I've learned in this course in my projects course later on.
